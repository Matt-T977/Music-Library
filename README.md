The music library is an application that is there to help the user compile a comprehensive list of 
their favorite or collected music in an intuitive and easy to use manner. This has been accomlplished
by using Django and Django REST Framework with a MySQL database to handle user generated data for their 
music library, as well as keeping track of all their likes and dislikes. All this will than be displayed 
on the client side by utilizing React.JS with Bootstrap for a responsive design. Application features included 
are a live search bar that will filter through results as the user types. The ability to add, delete, edit songs 
in their library as well as like or dislike them.
